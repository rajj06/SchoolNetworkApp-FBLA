## Correlation with problem 

The problem asked for an app to be made that included the ability for students and teacher to share photos, for students to view photos and events, for parents to notify teachers of absences, and other components. Additionaly, the problem asked for one additional component, which is the groups button. How the app works is that users are able to login. There are three different types of logins, one for school officals like teachers and principals, one for parents, and one for students. Then through a dashboard interface, the ability to do the tasks was given above. A messaging feature was added for the parent to communicate with the teacher, a view schedule component was added, and a sending photos feature with sharing integration was added.
